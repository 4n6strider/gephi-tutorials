== Simplest case: you already have a network file (gdf, gexf, etc.)

== !
Gephi handles the import of network files in a variety of formats:

image::network-formats-gephi-import-en.png[align="center",title="file formats supported by Gephi. Source: gephi.org"]

== !
To import any of these files, just choose the `File -> Open` menu


== Importing nodes with labels and their relations

== !
The easiest is probably to just have a text file like this one:

....
Source,Target <1>
Jeremy,Jennifer
Valerian,Jeremy
....
<1>This line is mandatory. Don't put a space between the comma and "Target"

Just write this in a text editor and save it as a file `example.txt`

== !

To import this file in Gephi, go to `File->Import Spreadsheet`. Then in the window:

image::Importing-nodes-with-labels-and-their-relations.png[align="center",title="Importing nodes with labels and their relations"]

== !
In this window, make sure the box "Create missing nodes" is checked:
