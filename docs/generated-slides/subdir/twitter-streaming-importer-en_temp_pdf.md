== Description of the plugin

//ST: Description of the plugin

== Installing the plugin

//ST: Installing the plugin

//ST: !
[WARNING]
The setup of the plugin will need you to create a Twitter account, if you don't already have one.
Get your Twitter login and password ready. **You also need a mobile phone number where your Twitter account can be confirmed**.

//ST: !
[CAUTION]
====
Setting up a Twitter account and creating a Twitter app is a boring task.
But it takes just 10 minutes, and you have to do it just once.

Let's go!

== Using the plugin

//ST: Using the plugin

//ST: !

image::Adding-terms-and-launching-the-collection-of-tweets.png[align="center", title="Adding terms and launching the collection of tweets"]

//ST: !

Be careful that if you choose very common terms, tweets will arrive fast and in large volumes.
If you don't have enough memory (RAM) on your computer, this could make it crash.
Click on "disconnect" to stop the collection of tweets.


//ST: !

//ST: Applying a layout while the tweets arrive.

You can see the users organize spatially in real time, while the tweets are being collected.

Just run Force Atlas 2 in the "Layout" panel. This will not interrupt the collection of tweets.

//ST: !

//ST: !
Shift to the `data laboratory` to view the data collected, in a spreadsheet format:

There, you can export nodes and relations ("edges") as csv files by clicking on "Export table".
