== Download a network file for this tutorial
//ST: Download a network file for this tutorial

//ST: !

link:../resources/miserables.zip[download this zip file] and unzip it on your computer.

You should find the file `miserables.gexf` in it.

Save it in a folder you will remember (or create a folder specially for this small project).

//ST: description of the file / the network
//ST: !

This file contains a network representing "who appears next to whom" in the 19th century novel _Les Misérables_ by Victor Hugofootnote:[D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993)].

A link between characters A and B means they appeared on the same page or paragraph in the novel.

The file name ends with ".gexf", which just means this is a text file where the network information is stored (name of the characters, their relations, etc.), following some conventions.


== open the network in Gephi
//open the network in Gephi
//ST: !
- open Gephi. On the Welcome screen that appears,  click on `Open Graph File`
- find `miserables.gexf` on your computer and open it

== read the report after opening a file

//ST: !
A report window will open, giving you basic info on the network you opened:

image::en/opening-file-report-en.png[align="center", title="report window"]

//ST: !
This tells you that the network comprises 74 characters, connected by 248 links.

Links are undirected, meaning that if A is connected to B, then it is the same as B connected to A.

The report also tells us the graph is not dynamic: it means there is no evolution or chronology, it won't "move in time".

Click on `OK` to see the graph in Gephi.

We can switch to the data laboratory to see the underlying data:

//ST: !
We see that the nodes of the network have many attributes. In particular, each have a Gender and a measure of how central they are:

//ST: !
This is the list of edges (relations) in the network. Notice that they have a "weight" (a "strength").
